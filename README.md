# reinforcement-learning-based-on-satellite-navigation
Reinforcement learning with PPO for satellite navigation and debris avoidance in a custom orbital simulation. Trains an agent to maintain stable orbit, avoid collisions, and manage fuel efficiently. Future scope includes 3D simulation, real data, and hardware-in-the-loop testing.
